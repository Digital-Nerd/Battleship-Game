# Battleship-Game
The game is similar to the minesweepers game, where some ships will be placed randomly on the grid and the user will have to search for those ships. It has 2 boards, HIDDEN_BOARD and GUESS_BOARD. Ships are placed at random in HIDDEN_BOARD and the user has to guess the location of the ships on GUESSS_BOARD. If the location of the ship matches in both boards then it's a hit, else miss. 'X' represents the location of the ship in HIDDEN_BOARD and hit on GUESS_BOARD. '-' represent miss on the GUESS_BOARD.
