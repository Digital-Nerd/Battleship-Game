# Battleship-Game
The game is similar to minesweepers game, where some ships will be placed randomly on the grid and the user will have to search for those ships.
It has 2 borads, HIDDEN_BOARD and GUESS_BOARD. 
Ships are placed at random in HIDDEN_BOARD and user has to guess the loaction of the ships on GUESSS_BOARD.
If the location of the ship matches in both boards then its a hit, else misss.
'X' represents location of ship in HIDDEN_BOARD and hit on GUESS_BOARD.
'-' represent miss on the GUESS_BOARD.
